# Contributors
Sky Guide (previously SkynetWiki) began in January 2021 as a quickly built knowledge base to help people to find everything they want to know about Sia and Skynet. Initially created by **Danger** and **MrFlux** using Wordpress, it was quickly joined by others and filled with many helpful resources.

During March and April 2021, **Covalent** and **Delivator** worked relentlessly on bringing Sky Guide to a next level - to turn it into truly community managed site, let others easily contribute through <a href="https://github.com/skynet-guide/skynet-guide.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, support translations and most importantly, making automated deploys to the Skynet.

In October 2021, Skynet Guide went through another major rework, bringing better structured hierarchy so users can quickly get to information based on their interests.
