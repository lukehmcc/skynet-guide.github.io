# Sia Foundation
The Sia network hardforked at beginning of 2021 to implement the Sia Foundation: a new non-profit entity led by Luke Champine that builds and supports distributed cloud storage infrastructure, with a specific focus on the Sia storage platform.

>This fork activated at a block height 298,000 which happened on **February 3rd 2021**.

<!-- Section about what the hardfork is -->
<details>
<summary>
<b>What is the hard fork?</b>
</summary>
<b>Hard fork is event when new version of software is released and it has different “rules”</b>. It results in two <i>seperate</i> blockchains, where one is being used by those who do not update and continue using old version. And the new blockchain that is using the new version. In this case, Sia is forking to introduce changes to the block reward.

Up to the point in time before its activation, both blockchains have identical history. It is as if someone duplicated it. If you held for example 1000 SC before, you will now have 1000 SC (which are actually 1000 SCC) on legacy blockchain and 1000 SC on the new one. But they are not the same, community usually gives them different tickers to distinguish them, like SC and SCC.

<b>Does it mean you will have double the amount of SC?</b> No. You <i>will</i> have twice the coins, but each set of coins is on a seperate network and all new transactions can only be on one chain. Let’s look at one good example from Sia’s own history. The fork in 2018 resulted in two chains: Sia (after update, used by versions 1.3.7 and higher, let’s call it SC after its currency) and the legacy one (used by those who didn’t update, which was called SCC(there were also other forks, but they're not important here)).

If you had SC before the fork, when the network split happened, you had same history (seed, blocks, addresses, transactions) on both blockchains, but after that moment, each blockchain went own way. That means you had same amount of different coins that weren’t compatible with each other – if you made transaction with SCC after the fork or mined coins on SCC chain, they would only exist on SCC blockchain, not on Sia. And vice versa.
<blockquote>
Since this fork was well accepted by vast majority of the community<i>there is no legacy chain expected to survive</i>. You can still access your legacy coins if you use the old wallet software at any point in future, but there will be no one who continues using it. In other words, it will(in all likelyhood) be worthless.
