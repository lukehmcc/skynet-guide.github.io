### <a href="https://github.com/tbenz9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siasync</a>
Siasync is a utility that will monitor a folder and synchronize its contents to the Sia network. As new files are created or removed it will keep Sia in sync with the local source folder. Siasync also supports more advanced features like only syncing certain file extensions, or excluding certain file extensions, or archive mode which wonâ€™t delete files from Sia even if they are deleted locally. Best of all, it works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
